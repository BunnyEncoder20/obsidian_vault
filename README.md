# obsidian_vault
- In this repo (vault) I'll keep everything I make notes on and Hopefully organize all the little bits of info into here so that I don't need to always search each small cmd online
- This will also help in storing assets at one folder
- Will also give me a proper place to store all my excalidraw files.
