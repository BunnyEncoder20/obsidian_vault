# Centralized Backups

1. Borg being Linux first, not the best option for a centralized backup if the central server is running windows

## Comparing all the Options

| **Bacula / Bareos**                            | Strong: native Windows client (File Daemon), Linux clients also. ([Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/15.0.x-manuals/en/main/Windows_Version_Bacula.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Windows Version of Bacula"))   | Bare-metal is possible (with extra tooling, VSS / image-type backups) but more complex. Bareos has some support.                                                                                                                                                       | Yes, you can select files/folders via FileSets. ([Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/en/dev-manual/main/main/Windows_Version_Bacula.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Windows Version of Bacula")) | Yes — incremental etc. Bacula supports scheduling of full/incremental etc.                                                                                                                                              | Moderate: deduplication is less built-in than some newer tools; more about efficient storage & pooling. | Security: uses authentication, can use encryption; but you will need to configure carefully. Windows VSS plugin helps for consistent backups. ([docs.baculasystems.com](https://docs.baculasystems.com/BEDedicatedBackupSolutions/Applications/OnPremise/vss/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "VSS Plugin")) | Yes — centralized server, monitoring, catalog, etc. Very mature.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Mostly open‐source; enterprise / support / plugin features may cost. Need to invest in learning / setup.                                                                                                                                                    | **Pros:** Very mature, scalable, good for many clients. **Cons:** Steep learning curve; full image restore more involved; admin overhead.                                                                                              |
| **Kopia**                                      | Good: works on Windows & Linux. CLI + GUI. ([kopia.io](https://kopia.io/docs/installation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Download & Installation \| Kopia"))                                                          | _Does not_ do whole-machine imaging or bare metal restore out of the box. It is file/folder / snapshot level. ([kopia.io](https://kopia.io/docs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is Kopia? \| Kopia"))                                                                    | Strong: you choose what directories/files to snapshot.                                                                                                                                        | Yes: supports incremental snapshotting, policies, etc. ([kopia.io](https://kopia.io/docs/features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Features \| Kopia"))                                                                         | Yes: dedup across snapshots. Compression.                                                               | Yes: encryption; secure transport; policies. ([kopia.io](https://kopia.io/docs/features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Features \| Kopia"))                                                                                                                                                                         | Some central features: repository server mode + API for multiple machines. Not as full-featured enterprise server UI as some older tools but improving. ([kopia.io](https://kopia.io/docs/features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Features \| Kopia")) | Open-source, free; all major functions available; few “enterprise” features may be limited.                                                                                                                                                                 | **Pros:** Lightweight, modern, secure, very good for file/folder backup; relatively easy to setup. **Cons:** No full image backup; if you need bare-metal / OS recovery of Windows + apps + boot, might need separate tool.            |
| **Duplicacy**                                  | Good: cross-platform (Windows, Linux). CLI + GUI. ([duplicacy.com](https://www.duplicacy.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duplicacy"))                                                                              | Not designed to do image / OS bare metal backups. It backs up files/folder/snapshots.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes, selective.                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes: has incremental backups, dedup chunking, etc. ([GitHub](https://github.com/georgyo/duplicacy-cli?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GitHub - georgyo/duplicacy-cli: A new generation cloud backup tool"))                     | Very good: dedup among clients, chunk-level, with storage efficiency.                                   | Encryption is supported. Secure transport / encryption at rest is possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Some central monitoring via GUI jobs + dashboard; but less “agent-server” style compared to Bacula etc.                                                                                                                                          | Free for CLI & basic, GUI / commercial features require license for business / non-personal use. ([duplicacy.com](https://www.duplicacy.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duplicacy"))                                                                           | **Pros:** Efficient dedup; good for many small to medium clients; relatively simpler than Bacula. **Cons:** No image / OS backup; licensing cost may exist depending on scale / usage.                                                 |
| **Veeam Agent (Windows / Linux, Free + Paid)** | Strong: native Windows agent; Linux agent also free. ([Veeam Software](https://www.veeam.com/products/free/microsoft-windows.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Free Windows Backup Solution for PCs and Endpoints")) | Yes: you can do image-based backups of Windows machines (entire computer), volumes. Bare metal restore etc. ([Veeam Software](https://www.veeam.com/products/free/microsoft-windows.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Free Windows Backup Solution for PCs and Endpoints")) | Yes: also folder/file backup.                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes: supports incremental etc. ([Veeam Software](https://www.veeam.com/products/free/linux.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Free Backup for Linux workloads - Veeam Agent for Linux"))                                      | Good: though dedup / compression features are there; often Veeam storage formats are efficient.         | Very good: encryption, security; also support for volume snapshots, snapshot drivers, bootable media.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | With the full Veeam suite you get centralized control; with agents you might have some reporting. For a small number of machines, agent-based with network share target works.                                                                   | Free versions have limitations (e.g. limit on features, targets, number of workloads); paid version adds more. ([veeamapps.com](https://www.veeamapps.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Veeam Backup & Replication Free Downloads \| Community Edition"))        | **Pros:** Good if you need image + file backups; strong reliability and restore options; well-known tool. **Cons:** Cost for full central management; depends what free tier gives; might be heavier-weight; licensing complexity.     |
| **Macrium Reflect**                            | Very strong for Windows; Linux less so (no native).                                                                                                                                                             | Yes: full disk / partition images; restore etc. ([images.macrium.com](https://images.macrium.com/products/business/standalone/workstation?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Macrium Software \| Reflect Workstation"))                                                           | Yes: file/folder backup as well.                                                                                                                                                              | Incremental/differential in paid versions. Free version is more limited. ([macrium-reflect.cc](https://www.macrium-reflect.cc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Macrium Reflect Download - Complete Backup & Imaging Solution")) | Good for image storage, but dedup across machines is not strong. More per-machine.                      | Encryption etc present in paid editions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Less “central server” style for many clients unless you buy business editions.                                                                                                                                                                   | Free version has limitations; to get everything (network backup, scheduling, incremental etc) may need paid. ([macrium-reflect.cc](https://www.macrium-reflect.cc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Macrium Reflect Download - Complete Backup & Imaging Solution")) | **Pros:** Very good imaging + restore features; tried and tested on Windows; good for small number of machines. **Cons:** Doesn’t do Linux clients well; free version limited; central management / scaling to many machines may cost. |

| **Platform support**     | Windows, Linux, macOS                                                                                     | Windows, Linux, macOS                                                                                                                 |
| **Centralization**       | Has **Kopia server mode** — you can run a central server and point clients to it. Also has a web GUI.     | No true “server + agent” model. Each client can back up to a shared repository, but you’ll need to script/monitor centrally yourself. |
| **Deduplication**        | Chunk-based dedup across snapshots & machines, efficient storage.                                         | Very strong dedup (one of its highlights) — even better cross-client dedup in some scenarios.                                         |
| **Encryption**           | End-to-end encryption, configurable.                                                                      | Also end-to-end encryption.                                                                                                           |
| **Monitoring**           | Kopia has a web UI where you can see snapshot history & status (if run in server mode).                   | No built-in monitoring; you’d have to build scripts/logging.                                                                          |
| **Ease of use**          | CLI + GUI. The GUI makes setup and monitoring simpler, especially if multiple Windows users are involved. | CLI only (unless you buy the GUI). CLI is fine, but less friendly for non-technical staff.                                            |
| **Community & activity** | Actively developed, modern design, growing adoption.                                                      | Mature, stable, but smaller community. Development not as fast.                                                                       |

After careful analysis, I have finally chosen to move forward with [[Kopia]].
