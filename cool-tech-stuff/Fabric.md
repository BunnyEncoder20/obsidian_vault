# Fabric (AI Tool)

- Fabric prompts are best at getting better results from AIs 
- It can connect to youtube, Online AI models (OpenAI, Claude) and even local private LLMS 
- It could have a potential use in the future when we are integrating our AI into the IETM project but for now, seems like a far fetch tbh. Will have to but it in the back seat for now.
