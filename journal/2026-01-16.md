## Thursday Night, 20:53 hrs

It was a normal day. Today was the first day I was on my own since morning till night. Think I did pretty well.

The Morning went into looking at the codebase of the File convertor project of Darpan and also seeing the results of the Elections (yes forgot to mention, I gave vote yesterday. And Yes BJP won like always). Me, Rihan and Ammar were discussion how can we rewrite the entire project in a hyper performant compile language so we could handle the performance issue which the project was currently facing. Our Top language choices are Go, Odin (not really this one maybe) and Zig. Though I am thinking is that Go might be the perfect enough fit for both performance and devEx. Rihan and Ammar are pushing for C++ like always.

The second half was a little guiding Darpan on how to implement some additional complex features in his project. Then I was pinging the chatGPT so that it gives me the best language for our use case. Here is the table for the same:

I have also been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. Also I sense myself becoming more and more of a fanboy of **ThePrimeagen** & **DHH**. These people are my gods of Modern programming and I really like their Philosophy of programming. 

Both think that the on ramp to programming should be super simple, but should have complexity ramp going up to infinity. I really like it. I want to be excited to learn a new language but also I would really like to be able to build whatever I want and be continuously learning it to become more and more Competent.

As **DHH** said: _"It is always fun to be more Competent"_

I have starting to like the philosophy of **Ruby** and it's framework for the web:  **Ruby on Rails**. They are also built with the idea that programming languages do not need to be super complex and ugly to write. It could be elegant and beautiful and make you feel super nice to code in it everyday. I mean if you have seen the for loop or the if conditional block of **Ruby** you know what I am talking about. 

Though I would really like to test it out on the projects of the Office, think I would have to wait for the new projects at least after the current IETM, LMS and CTMR to be able to change the stack to Rails.
I need to start working on the backend of LMS Tbh instead of fantasying about new languages, frameworks and side projects like rewrite a already built project in a far harder language which we actually have to learn first just to 10x the performance.

But I am really feel like I am learning a lot more stuff about tech and the life of programmers and also how I should be looking at programming. I **LOVE** being competent and I **LOVE** writing code and building websites. I want to learn I want to **ENJOY** learning these new frameworks and coding language, not feel like a fooking prisoner forced to read and code javascript all day. And **Ruby** gets me excited for that.

Had my dinner while listening to the Rails Worlds Conference which is being watched by **ThePrimeagen**. What a time to be alive. Now I just need to become a highly cracked developer now.
