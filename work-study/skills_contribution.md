# Skills & Contributions Speech

“ Hey everyone, I’m Varun. I mostly do everything backend — that place where nobody knows what I do until something breaks. Then suddenly the entire dept will be after me. Think of me as a Jack of all trades

I work with Python and Javascript and fimilar with Frameworks like Node - Express and FastAPI. Databases? Yep - SQL, NoSQL I can make anything work.
I’m also into Docker and microservices, which is just a fancy way of saying I like breaking one big problem into 10 smaller ones that crash independently.

How I can contribute here? I am here to build and optimize backend systems, make APIs the frontend actually likes, seperation of business logics and make sure the DB queries don’t secretly start a mining operation for Bitcoin.

And honestly, I just like solving problems, learning new technologies, and building things that don’t fall apart in production… at least not until the demo is over.

Apart from work, my hobbies include riding my motorcyle and eating Pizza.

My role model is Batman.

So yeah, like any good backend dev, I’m here to code, debug, and occasionally question my life choices ”
