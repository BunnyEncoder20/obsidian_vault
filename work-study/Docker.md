- What are containers ?
    - Think of em as micro computers
    - They have their own:
        - OS
        - CPU 
        - Memory
        - Network
    - They are properly isolated from each other
    - They are lightweight (often striped down to only necessary core files)
    - Hence they are wicked fast.
